html5lib has its own Unicode, Dammit-like system. Converting the input
to Unicode should be up to the builder. The lxml builder would use
Unicode, Dammit, and the html5lib builder would be a no-op.

Calculate tag.string dynamically rather than when creating the
tree. The html5lib builder doesn't use popTag, and adding/removing
things from the tree after the fact may also change the
value/availability of tag.string.
